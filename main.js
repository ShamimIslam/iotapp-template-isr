    The Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) sample application distributed within IntelÂ® XDK IoT Edition under the IoT with Node.js Projects project creation option showcases how an ISR to call when an interrupt occurs.

    MRAA - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on GNU/Linux platforms
    Library in C/C++ to interface with Galileo & other Intel platforms, in a structured API with port names/numbering that match compatible boards & with bindings to javascript.

    Steps for installing MRAA & UPM Library on Intel IoT Platform with IoTDevKit Linux* image and an active internet connection
    Using a ssh client: 
    1. echo "src maa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/1.1/intelgalactic" > /etc/opkg/intel-iotdk.conf
    2. opkg update
    3. opkg upgrade
